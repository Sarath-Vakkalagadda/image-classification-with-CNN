# image-classification-with-CNN

This project focuses on classifying images of dogs and cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with the Keras library. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. The CNN model is designed to recognize and distinguish between images of dogs and cats.

# Requirements
TensorFlow
Keras
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
